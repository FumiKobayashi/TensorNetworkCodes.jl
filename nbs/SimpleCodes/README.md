# SimpleCodes

These are some tools for quantum error correcting codes in Julia.  It includes a basic type (`SimpleCode`) for stabilizer codes and some useful functions like `distance`, `purify_code` and `random_code`.

This will be replaced by David Tuckett's [Qecsim.jl](https://github.com/dkt29/Qecsim.jl).
